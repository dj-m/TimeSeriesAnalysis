Definition of Time Series: An _ordered_ sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals.

Time Series has _some things_ in common with probability & regression
- Mean & Standard Deviation
  - The mean and/or variance (standard deviations) change through time series processes despite the parts being described, in many cases, through randomized variable with statistical moments.
  
However, if you sampled/pulled from a time series distribution, would you be able to plot out the data points in a similar fashion to the image on the left, below:
